                    SeeShells analyzes the shellbags stored in a Windows registry hive and interprets them as Shell Events. 
                    Each Shell Event documents an action taken by a user that resulted in a change to their Windows Machine. 
                    For example, when a user connects a removable storage device to their Windows system, the file system is 
                    altered to display the removable storage device and its contents. The resulting changes to the user's 
                    Windows registry hive can be read and interpreted by SeeShells as a Shell Event that describes the Removable 
                    Storage Device Connect action.

                    action, the user that performed the action, the time at which the action was taken, any file system 
                    locations associated with the action, and all parsed shellbag data that provide evidence for the action.
